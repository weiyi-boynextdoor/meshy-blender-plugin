# meshy-blender-plugin
https://www.meshy.ai/ meshy.ai (former named taichi-graphics) is an AIGC company which supports AI-generated 3d textures and models.

This repo originated from https://docs.meshy.ai/meshy-for-blender-introduction. the original souce code is available at https://cdn.meshy.ai/meshy-for-blender/meshy-for-blender-0.1.2.zip. This is not an official. I don't work for them (actually I was fired by them). I just fix bugs and add new features for hobby.

When the hype surrounding AIGC entrepreneurship subsides, people will realize that Blender is the eternal god.
